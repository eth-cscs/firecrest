## [1.13.1]

### Added

- Tasks microservice now provides filtering by a subset of tasks with a `tasks` parameter
  - `GET /tasks?tasks=<taskid>,<taskid>,<taskid>`

- Tasks microservice now reports in task metadata the system for which the task was created

- For storage tasks, now the `source` and `target` path are part of the `data` field on the response for all statuses

- For certificator container sets up the environment variables `F7T_CA_KEY_PATH` and `F7T_PUB_USER_KEY_PATH` as absolute paths in the container for the CA Private key (`ca-key`) and the user key (`user-key.pub`), respectively. If not set, the default directory will be root (ie, `/ca-key`)

- For the rest of microservices, the value to set is `F7T_PRIV_USER_KEY_PATH` (`user-key`)

- The `head` endpoint has a new argument: `skip_ending`. The output will be the whole file, without the last NUM bytes/lines of each file.

- The `tail` endpoint has a new argument: `skip_beginning`. The output will start with byte/line NUM of each file.
