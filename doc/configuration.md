# FirecREST configuration

FirecREST microservices read their configuration from environment variables. Most of them can be stored in a shared file (`common.env`) and others should be passed independently, such as secrets or specific parameters.


The environment variables can be grouped in:
1. Service internal properties
    1. Service discovery and network properties (port, SSL, URL)
    2. Service behavior (debug, timeout, max file size)
    3. Task persistence (Redis)
2. Site/cluster integration
    1. IAM integration
        1. OIDC integration with Keycloak
        2. OPA
    2. Clusters and internal machines that provide services
        1. Slurm parameters, Spank, transfer partition
        2. Reservation tool parameters
    3. Object Storage (credential, account, properties)
    4. Gateway (Kong)
    5. Tracing (Jaeger)



## 1. Service internal properties

Notes:
a. Variable `F7T_SYSTEMS_PUBLIC` has a list of public names seen by client/user. Internal variables  `F7T_SYSTEMS_INTERNAL_COMPUTE`, `F7T_SYSTEMS_INTERNAL_UTILITIES`, `F7T_USE_SPANK_PLUGIN`, `F7T_COMPUTE_BASE_FS`, `F7T_STORAGE_JOBS_MACHINE` must have the same order and length, matching to internal URIs/options. Example: for `F7T_SYSTEMS_PUBLIC='publicName1;publicName2'`  then `F7T_SYSTEMS_INTERNAL_COMPUTE='172.16.1.2:22;compute2:2022'`
b. `F7T_REALM_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY`  has the RSA public key from Keycloak realm (or other OIDC provider). It's is used to validate JWT tokens included on requests (via 'Authorization' header). If empty, no verification is made on the token, which is only useful for debugging. Additionally, if not running in debug mode (`F7T_DEBUG_MODE`) microservices will log a warning. As some systems are tricky with variables containing multiple lines,  use only one line without headers (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`, `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`), they'll be added by F7T. This variable and related ones are static so microservices do not need to contact the OIDC server.
c. All lists are semi colon separated. Single and double quotes are removed from start and end of all variables.
